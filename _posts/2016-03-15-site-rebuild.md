excerpt: For a while now, this site has lain dormant. Time for a rebuild and a new lease of life

For a while now, this site has lain dormant, lacking in updates and generally embarassing me that it hasn't been updated.

The thing is, I find Jekyll a pain to work with. I need to have boot up my local version, add a post to the drafts folder, write it in markdown, compile, test, move to posts and push to GitHub. Sure, I could just add my post directly into GitHub and run away (I'm doing that right now) but I usually need to remember the file naming conventions, copy the meta information from another post and then relearn markdown.

I want something I can build once, and then just login to an admin area and add/update posts/pages via an editor like TinyMCE.

## Why Laravel?

I could just build the new site in a CMS I already know - Wordpress, Perch or even Umbraco. But I want to learn something new. I set myself the goal at the turn of the year that I wanted to learn Laravel (and Vue). So this would seem like as good a challenge to learn by doing as any.

### How?

I've been learning a bit of [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) via [Jeffrey Way](https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way)'s brilliant [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/) resource. It's amazing, and a bargain at $9 a month, but I learn better with direct real world examples.
So I started googling around for neat tutorials a few days ago, and think I have stumbled across an [eBook/Blog](http://laravelcoding.com/blog?tag=L5+Beauty) which may be perfect by [Chuck Heintzelman](http://laravelcoding.com/blog). So here goes nothing...

...of course, if you are reading this in a few months time, and it is still hosted on GitHub pages. Then I have failed miserably.
