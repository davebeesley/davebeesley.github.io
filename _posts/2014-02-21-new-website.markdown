Wow, so I finally got my new website up and running. It's pretty basic at the moment, but I aim for it to grow and grow.

This new site mainly grew out of the fact I have spent a lot of time thinking, mainly while swimming or exercising at the gym, of possible blog posts etc. But with a lack of place to publish them, the enthusiasm for them wained (I know I could have published them to Medium, but I don't think my thoughts are quite Medium-worthy).

### Now for the geeky bit

I decided that I wanted to build this site out on [Github][github], thus learning [Jekyll][jekyll] and Markdown at the same time. Also this site utilises the wonderful [Sass][sass] framework [inuit.css][inuit-css].
The brilliant thing about using [Github][me-on-github] is that if I screw any code up, make a typo, or just plain get things wrong. You can suggest changes to me via an issue or a pull request.

It won't just be webby, I intend to add more of my geeky thoughts on here. So, watch this space for more from me.
