A few days ago, I treated myself to a FitBit. My reasoning being that, after losing two stone in training for the Great North Run last year, I have put it all back on again.

Being a Web Developer, my day to day life as you would expect is extremely sedentary. Add to that a pre-disposition to habitually eat, and you have a recipe for "bloat". A couple of good friends of mine, one of which is also a Web Developer, have had a great level of success in losing weight just by adding a FitBit to their lives.

I have been using it for 24 hours now, and I'm very impressed. The main thing that it has highlighted to me is the connection between what I eat and how much I move. The FitBit takes a few statistics from you when you set it up through the web interface, and I presume works out your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). Your BMR is basically the amount of calories your body would burn keeping you alive if you lay perfectly still all day. The calories burned ticker, ticks upwards all day based on this and how much it is detecting you moving. Then, by inputting what you eat (I have found FitBit's food database limited as it is presumably a US company, but it connects nicely to My Fitness Pal so I track my food intake through this) it adds up your calorie intake. The FitBit interface, either on the web or though your smartphone app, outputs a graphical representation of how you are doing based on your weight loss goals - "Under Budget" meaning you could have eaten more, "Nailed It!" meaning you have done perfectly today, and "Over Budget" meaning you may need to go for a walk/run/swim to bring things back into line. This is being constantly updated, so you know when you are going astray before you have blown it completely.

Another great feature is the sleep monitoring and silent alarm. The wristband silent vibrates to wake you, so you don't wake your partner, and when in sleep mode it monitors your sleep quality. I had assumed that sleep mode coupled with the silent alarm could be used to have the FitBit wake you at the optimum point in your sleep nearest to when you desire to wake up. But I am yet to find this feature, today it woke me at 8.30 on the dot.

All in all, I think the FitBit is a cracking piece of kit, and will really help me achieve my weight loss goal. Something I have struggled with is striking a balance between eating sensibly and getting exercise, whilst still enjoying food. I think this will allow me to have my cake and eat it, while still losing weight comfortably and not overdoing the exercise to the point I just give up.
