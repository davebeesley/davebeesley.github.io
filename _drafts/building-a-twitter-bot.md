<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Could someone please make a Twitter bot that replies to all tweets containing the phrase &#39;to be frank&#39; with a picture of Frank Spencer?</p>&mdash; rodti (@rodti) <a href="https://twitter.com/rodti/status/600427981933301760">May 18, 2015</a></blockquote>

I have been looking for an interesting coding challenge for a few weeks now, so.... Challenge Accepted!
