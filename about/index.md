Hi, I'm David and I'm a Front End Web Developer based in Gloucestershire, UK. Primarily focussing on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Although I have been known to get my hands dirty in some PHP and C# code too.

I began building websites as a hobbyist back in the "dark ages" before CSS. Building table based layouts in Dreamweaver for friends. Then I went to University to pursue a "proper career."

After a few years at Uni, and a few more in retail jobs, I embarked on a career in IT support before moving back into Web Development in 2010 (having taught myself the basics of CSS in a weekend).

Since returning to Web Development, I have been very fortunate to work for three wonderful agencies (including my current role at [firehoop][firehoop]) and some amazing local, national and international clients.

Away from the web, I'm married to the wonderful Helen and have recently become a father to my beautiful daughter Eva. I am a proud (but suffering) supporter of Liverpool Football Club and also an amateur brewer of Cider and Ale.
